\section{Introduction}
Process Mining is a young approach connecting machine learning and data mining with the process modelling and analysis to extracting knowledge from event log in aim to do all needed process discovery, monitoring and improve current process. Briefly, it is the link between process data captured from ERP systems (e.g., SAP Business Suite,..etc) and the process model \cite{manifesto}.
The International Business Process Challenge BPIC 2017\footnote{Tue, BPIC 2017, https://www.win.tue.nl/bpi/doku.php?id=2017:challenge} is proposed from the Dutch financial institute in The Netherlands. Due to success has been achieved in BPIC 2012, the workflow was updated to handle the considerable case volume increment. The personal loan application process needs to perform more effectively regarding the time of interaction between the company and the client, in addition, offering the good offer to right client is also a challenge limits the quality of loan process. Moreover, drilling deeper into the process and data available by real life event-log delivers a good vision and provides further insights for more production process.
