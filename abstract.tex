\chapter*{ABSTRACT}
\ {A}lthough process mining is the bridge connecting between data mining and machine learning, both of procedures can be involved side a side to achieve better approaches to treat business process data  and at the same time to obtain a better predictive model serves data engineers while they mine the overlapping process data.
Process monitoring (and what of business process analytic systems) is the common domain which aim to predict future information about process, outcome or remaining time starting by certain prefix length of a running case.
The hereafter thesis starts by applying business process mining technics to find most suitable departure for further mining of data and learning a predictive model. Real data from a loan process of Dutch institute in the Netherlands have been invested in the study.
